## Step-by-step implementation
1. Implement the simple linear regression algorithm as per the steps provided in [Coding step-by-step](Coding_Linear_Regression.md) and get a hang on how the implementation works.

## Playing around with data
2. Add some more data points to the age & salary lists and try the program.
3. Generate data points using random number generator and try the program.
