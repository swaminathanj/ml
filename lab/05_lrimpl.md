# Linear Regression - Implementation & Analysis

## Step-by-step implementation
1. Implement the simple linear regression algorithm as per the steps provided in [Coding step-by-step](Coding_Linear_Regression.md) and get a hang on how the implementation works.

## Playing around with data
2. Add some more data points to the age & salary lists and try the program.
3. Generate data points using random number generator and try the program.
4. Come up with data points such that the program will underfit.
5. Create the data set which exactly obeys y = 2x + 1 equation. Suppose you were to start with m=0, c=0, does your program yield 2 & 1 respectively?
6. Load the data set from a CSV file for a real example and see how it works.

## Playing around with m and c
7. Does starting with a different inital values for m and c matter and check if you are able to get the same final m and c.
