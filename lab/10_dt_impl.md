# Decision Tree Implementation - Lab Activity

1. Implement a program in python that computes the Gini impurity of each feature for a given dataset with 3 features.  Use the example dataset discussed in the class.
   <table>
     <tr align="center">       <th>Loves Popcorn</th>       <th>Loves Soda</th>       <th>Age</td>       <th>Loves Icecream</th>     </tr>
     <tr align="center">       <td>Yes</td>       <td>Yes</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>No</td>     </tr>
     <tr align="center">       <td>Yes</td>       <td>No</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>No</td>     </tr>
     <tr align="center">       <td>No</td>       <td>Yes</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>Yes</td>     </tr>
     <tr align="center">       <td>No</td>       <td>Yes</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>Yes</td>     </tr>
     <tr align="center">       <td>Yes</td>       <td>Yes</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>Yes</td>     </tr>
     <tr align="center">       <td>Yes</td>       <td>No</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>No</td>     </tr>
     <tr align="center">       <td>No</td>       <td>No</td>       <td>83</td>       <td>No</td>     </tr>
   </table>
   
2. Generate from the scratch implementation of decision tree (based on Gini impurity) and understand the code.
3. Generate an implementation that uses Entropy as opposed to Gini impurity and understand the code.
4. Compare both the implementations in terms of structure and logic.
5. Do you think for a given test data, both implementations would do the same classification? Justify.
6. For any downloaded data set (from pandas or scikit-learn), try the decision tree implemenation and see it working. You may have to make changes to the code to process the input.
7. Use Scikit-learn's Decision Tree implementation on the above downloaded data set.
8. Use Tensor Flow's Decision Tree implementation on the above downloaded data set.
