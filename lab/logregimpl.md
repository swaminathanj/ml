# Logistic Regression - Lab activity

## Understand the code
1. Check out the code in ([Logistic Regression Implmentation](../notes/Coding_Logistic_Regression.md)) and understand the its connection with the math behind.
2. Run the code in Google Colab and understand its working.

## Play around with data (keep x single dimensional)
3. Change the data points and see its effect on the output
4. Generate data points using random number generator and try the program.
5. Try to come up with data points such that the program will perfectly fit.
6. Try to come up with data points such that the program will underfit.
7. Load the data set from a CSV file for a real example and see how it works.

## Play around with training parameters (keep x single dimensional)
8. Does starting with a different inital values for w and b matter? Check if you are able to get the same (very close to) final w and c. Prove by experiment.
9. Suppose you updated only w (but not b), how would the gradient descent work. What is final value of w? How does it compare with original experiment?
10. Suppose you updated only b (but not w), how would the gradient descent work. What is final value of b? How does it compare with original experiment?
    
## Play around with running rate (keep x single dimensional)
11. Observe the behavior of the program for different values of running_rate.
12. Does the running rate have any influence of number of iterations? Substantiate with experiments.

## Play around with linear regression formula (keep x single dimensional)
13. Run the linear regression implementation with same data. What line you get?
14. What is the accuracy you get? with linear regression implementation?

## Try computing different classification metrics
15. Accuracy
16. Precision
17. Recall
18. F1 score
19. Confusion matrix
20. ROC curve and AUC

## Increase x dimension beyond 1
21. To be added
