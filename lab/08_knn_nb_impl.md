# Part 1: K-Nearest Neightbor (KNN) implementation

## KNN implementation for 1 feature
1. Consider the (xi, yi) pairs: [ (7, No), (12, No), (15, Yes), (11, Yes), (4, No), (17, Yes), (9, No), (5, No), (18, Yes), (21, Yes) ]. Note that x is single dimensional.
2. Implement KNN algorithm in python to determine which class does the following test data points belong to for k = 5.
   (i) x = 10,
   (ii) x = 13,
   (iii) x = 15
4. Determine the class for the above 3 test data points for K = 5.
5. Write down your observations from the above experiments.
